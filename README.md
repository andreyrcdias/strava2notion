## Step 2: Set Up Your Notion Database

- Pace (Text)
- Duration (Text)
- Elevation Gain (Number)
- Type (Text)
- Date (Date)
- Calories (Number)
2. Share the database with your integration:

- Under Connections, click on Connect to and search for your integration and invite it.

## Step 3: Create .env file
```shell
cp .env-example .env
```
> [!WARNING]
> Please note that you will have to update your .env file with your `STRAVA_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `STRAVA_REFRESH_TOKEN` after completing Stravaâ€™s OAuth flow.

## Step 4: Install Packages
```shell
npm install
```

## Step 5: Build the project
```shell
npm run build
```

## Step 6: Run the OAuth Flow
1. Start the OAuth Server:
```shell
node run server
```
2. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000:
    - You should see a page with a link to authorize with Strava.
3. Click the link to authorize with Strava:
    - This will redirect you to Strava's authorization page.
4. Authorize the application:
    - Strava will redirect you to a page with an authorization code.
5. The server will exchange the authorization code for an access token and refresh token:
    - The tokens will be displayed on the page.
6. Copy the refresh token and update your .env file with it.


## Step 7: Run the Integration
```shell
npm start
```
